## Description

As soon as Tamagotchi hatches, it will beep at you for attention. This is where the health meter comes in handy. You can determine the mood, health and behavior of Tomagotchi with the health meter. Tamagotchi will need to be fed and played with soon after it hatches. In order to start Tamagotchi on a good growth path, you must take good care of Tamagotchi right from the start.

* FEED: Press A button until knife and fork icon is highlighted, then press B. Select either Meal or Snack by pressing the B button to feed Tamagotchi. Be careful not to over feed Tamagotchi; if you do it will refuse to eat.

* PLAY: Press A button until the bat and ball icon is highlighted, then press B button to begin the game. The object is to guess which way Tamagotchi will turn. To choose left, press the A button, to choose right, press the B button. If you choose the correct direction, Tamagotchi will be happy. There are 5 chances in each game to match Tamagotchi; the more you match, the happier Tamagotchi will be. To stop the game press the C button. After playing, check the happiness meter to see if it went up or down.

* HEALTH METER: Check Tamagotchi's health, by pressing the A button until the Health Meter icon is highlighted, then press B button to check Tamagotchi's age/weight, discipline, hunger and happiness. After you have checked all the screens to see if Tamagotchi needs anything, press C to return to the main screen. You should also check this screen if Tamagotchi beeps at you and the "attention" icon is highlighted.
